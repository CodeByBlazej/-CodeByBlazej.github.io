Hi! I haven't posted for a while as TTY lessons, articles about it, and future algorithm lessons stopped me a little. Those who read my other article [Falling in love with Ruby](https://codebyblazej.com/posts/falling-in-love-with-ruby/) Might know I wasted some time fixing up my car last time. 

Well... This time I had a massive coolant leak but decided to give it to the garage as this time I had no room and access to tools to work on that. 

I was a bit lucky as the fixup turned out not to be too expensive, and I could focus on learning again.

## Event Manager

The Event Manager project was a deep dive into working with JSON, manipulating files, and reading CSV files. 

It was a longer project, and for the first time, The Odin Project guided us step by step. I appreciated this approach because it felt like a solid introduction to concepts Iâ€™ll likely revisit. 

Itâ€™s a great project to bookmark for future reference, especially since these skills will become second nature after repeated use.

Understanding how to build a hash for serialization took some time to click. Up until now, I relied heavily on arrays to solve most problems. 

This project highlighted the importance of hashes, and Iâ€™ve decided to focus on using them more in upcoming projects.

## Hangman

The Hangman project was one of my favorites so far. It reminded me of the [calculator project](https://codebyblazej.com/posts/the-odin-project-experience/), which was the final task in the foundations section. Every step felt intuitive, like I knew exactly what to do to solve each small problem.

That said, I hit a few roadblocks toward the endâ€”especially when trying to save the game state. Figuring out how to write valid JSON files and store them correctly took the most time. I had to revisit earlier lessons and piece everything together to make it work, but the effort was worth it.

## Advanced Ruby

The next in the line was Pattern Matching and Blocks. These lessons passed quite quickly and were not too difficult to understand.

Yeah, letâ€™s see in the future ðŸ˜€I can bet I will be coming to review them as well. 

But to be honest, it wasnâ€™t as bad. Pattern Matching and Blocks opened my eyes to more efficient ways to process data and pass instructions to methods. 

While these concepts are still new to me, I see how they can streamline collaboration in larger applications.


## Final Words

Iâ€™m currently working through the "A Bit of Computer Science" lesson, and I have no idea how long itâ€™ll take to finish. 

Once I complete the Ruby course, Iâ€™m considering writing a summary of the total hours Iâ€™ve spent on these lessonsâ€”similar to my previous article. Iâ€™ve been tracking my progress daily, and it might be interesting to share those numbers.

Let me know in the comments if thereâ€™s anything specific youâ€™d like me to elaborate on!
