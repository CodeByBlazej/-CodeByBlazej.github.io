Hey there! I'm Blazej. Welcome to my corner of the internet!


When I was young, I loved working on motorbikes—driving them, modifying them, and just getting my hands dirty with 2T and 4T engines. That passion stayed with me, and I still enjoy riding motorbikes whenever I get the chance. 


I also had a passion for cars and spent my free time doing engine swaps with friends in garages. And believe me - sometimes it wasn’t fun when things went sideways.


Interestingly, I also enjoyed sales. As a teen, I would go to the biggest car sales events in my area to sell online advertisements for car sellers. It was a great lesson and helped me step out of my comfort zone for the first time.


After that, I became a machinist and traveled around Europe, the USA, and Asia. Along the way, I’ve created two affiliate blogs, worked as a real estate agent selling over 15 properties, and gained valuable experience working with clients on both sides of the deal.


These days, I’m diving into programming to build apps and solve problems. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me enjoying my hobbies: riding motorbikes, snowboarding, and hiking.


Thanks for stopping by! Follow me on socials to stay updated with my journey and projects!
